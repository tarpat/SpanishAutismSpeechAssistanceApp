# Spanish Autism Speech Assistance App Project
## Created By: Tarun, Ajith, and Rishika

Children with autism have different ways of learning and thinking that we might assume. After
several discussions with parents of children who have autism, I have found that many typically 
pick up languages better when they relate words with images. There are many mobile applications
like this in American and many other first-world countries, but this isn't too prevalent in 
countries like Mexico where Spanish is a main language.

Small features in these images make a large difference in how the child picks up the language.
For example, the skin tone or the types of items present in the image should be familiar with
the child in their country, otherwise it is more difficult for them to pick up the language.

That is why we created this application, which makes it easier for native children with
autism learn Spanish.
